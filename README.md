### Development Comment

Add the id of the temporary extension to the list of allowed extensions to try the developer version. To do so, [download](https://github.com/andy-portmen/native-client/releases) the native client, edit the [config.js](https://github.com/andy-portmen/native-client/blob/master/config.js) file, then reinstall it.
